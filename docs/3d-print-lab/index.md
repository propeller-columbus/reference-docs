Here at Propeller, we have several 3D printers to choose from. We have two Bambu printers (X1C and P1S), two Ender Max printers, and three Ender 3 series printers. Members are afforded a small amound of filament each month, but if you require a lot of material, you'll need to bring your own filament.
