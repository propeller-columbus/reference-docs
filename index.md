# Welcome to Propeller!
Here you'll find a collection of documentation regarding available amenities, links to safety testing, and a few starter project ideas to get you going. If anything in this documentation is outdated, please don't hesitate to reach out to staff. We'll do our best to keep this updated!

## Communication on Equipment Status
If for any reason you find or leave a piece of equipment inoperable, please communicate this with staff. The more we know about downed equipment, the faster we can get it working again. If no one is around, at the very least, please leave a note.

## Equipment Instruction
Without proper instruction, please do not operate any equipment you are unfamiliar with.  Use these guides for reference only.
